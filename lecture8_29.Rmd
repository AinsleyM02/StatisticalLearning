1. Load the nycflights13 package, which contains airline on-time data for all flights departing
NYC in 2013. Also includes useful ‘metadata’ on airlines, airports, weather, and planes.
2. Load the tidyverse package
3. Using the flights data,
• find all flights that were less than 1000 miles (distance)
• Keep only the columns: dep_delay, arr_delay, origin, dest, air_time, and
distance
• Add the Z-score for departure delays
• Convert the departure and arrival delays into hours
# just did until here
• Calculate the average flight speed (in mph)
• order by average flight speed (fastest to slowest)
• return the first 12 rows

```{r}
#install.packages("nycflights13")
#library(nycflights13)
#library(tidyverse)

data("flights")

flights %>%
  filter(
    distance<=1000
  ) %>%
  select(
    dep_delay, arr_delay, origin, dest, air_time, distance
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    dep_delay_z=(dep_delay - mean(dep_delay, na.rm=T))/sd(dep_delay, na.rm=T) # is missing data in dep delays so remove it or the whole new column is filled with na
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    #dep_delay_hr=dep_delay/60, # could do it this way
    #arr_delay_hr=arr_delay/60,
    across(ends_with("delay"), \(x) x/60, .names="{.col}_hr") # across with a annonmous lambda function
    # could also have written fuction(x) x/60
  )

```
